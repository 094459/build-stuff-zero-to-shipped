- **ASH version**: 3.1.2

## Summary

### Scanner Results

The table below shows findings by scanner, with status based on severity thresholds and dependencies:

- **Severity levels**:
  - **Suppressed (S)**: Findings that have been explicitly suppressed and don't affect scanner status
  - **Critical (C)**: Highest severity findings that require immediate attention
  - **High (H)**: Serious findings that should be addressed soon
  - **Medium (M)**: Moderate risk findings
  - **Low (L)**: Lower risk findings
  - **Info (I)**: Informational findings with minimal risk
- **Duration (Time)**: Time taken by the scanner to complete its execution
- **Actionable**: Number of findings at or above the threshold severity level that require attention
- **Result**:
  - **PASSED** = No findings at or above threshold
  - **FAILED** = Findings at or above threshold
  - **MISSING** = Required dependencies not available
  - **SKIPPED** = Scanner explicitly disabled
  - **ERROR** = Scanner execution error
- **Threshold**: The minimum severity level that will cause a scanner to fail
  - Thresholds: ALL, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
  - Source: Values in parentheses indicate where the threshold is set:
    - `global` (global_settings section in the ASH_CONFIG used)
    - `config` (scanner config section in the ASH_CONFIG used)
    - `scanner` (default configuration in the plugin, if explicitly set)
- **Statistics calculation**:
  - All statistics are calculated from the final aggregated SARIF report
  - Suppressed findings are counted separately and do not contribute to actionable findings
  - Scanner status is determined by comparing actionable findings to the threshold
